          </h2>
            <p>In the beginning, you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores, crafting mechanical arms, and transport belts by hand. 
              Still, in a short time, you can become an industrial powerhouse with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacturing 
              and deploying construction, and logistic robots, all for your resource needs.</p>
            <p> However, this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources 
              does not sit nicely with the locals, so you must be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire. </p>
            <strong>In Factorio, the your base is in your hands!</strong>
