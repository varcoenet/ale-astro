## Expands New Customer Acquisition Opportunity

**Oakwood, Georgia, 8/3/2020–** AleForge, LLC [(https://aleforge.net/)](https://aleforge.net), one of the leading game server and web hosts in the industry, today announced the company is accepting Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, XRP and ETH, as well as four dollar-pegged stablecoins, USDC, GUSD, PAX, and BUSD, for payment for goods and services from [BitPay](https://bitpay.com/), the world’s largest provider of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment services. The ability to accept cryptocurrency expands AleForge into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical. AleForge benefits by adding cryptocurrency to its payment options while reducing high fees increasing payment transparency and efficiency. AleForge’s hosting capabilities are unparalleled in the fact that their high-end security, performance, and transparency allow customers to know the exact going on of their services at any point in time. AleForge’s customers can rest easy since they know their hosting is secured and backed with AleForge's guarantee.

“We decided to accept cryptocurrency because it allows our customers more flexibility in payment outside the standard credit card and PayPal and gives them the option to help keep their privacy on the internet,” Manager at AleForge. “We chose BitPay to manage our merchant processing because they make it easy and handle the entire process of getting the Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash from the customer and depositing cash into our account.”

“AleForge realizes the potential for cryptocurrency to transform the hosting industry, making payments faster, more secure, and less expensive on a global scale,” said Sean Rolland, Director of Product Management at BitPay. “Our goal is to make accepting cryptocurrency a seamless process.”

Blockchain uses distributed ledger technology which is essentially an open, online spreadsheet. A major advantage is that blockchain provides incredible transactional transparency as every transaction is verified, recorded, and stored. This process creates highly efficient services and an overall better experience for AleForge customers.
