## Eye Protection For Gamers - How To Protect Your Eyes Properly

Gaming is a great way to immerse yourself in a virtual world and escape reality, but it can also be bad for your eyes if you’re not careful. It is an activity available to anyone with a device, whether a PC, phone, tablet or a specific platform device; gaming is everywhere. However, gaming can also be a professional career for those with the skill to compete in tournaments and leagues. Both professional and casual gamers must protect their eyes from potential damage. Professional gamers spend much time looking at the screen, much like your average office job, and they need to take extra steps to ensure their eyes are safe. Luckily, from finding companies that sell blue light glasses to ergonomics and gaming-specific glasses, there are plenty of options to protect your eyes. The best choice can vary from person to person depending on the type of gaming, device, and environment. Hence, it is crucial to understand what kind of protection you need and how it should be used.

### Proper Lighting For Gamer’s Eyes

It is important to ensure that your gaming environment is adequately lit as it can reduce eyestrain and headaches while playing a game. Overhead lighting should be kept at medium levels since too bright lighting can cause a glare on the screen, which causes eyestrain. If you’re playing on a laptop, it is recommended to use an external monitor since laptops can have harsh backlighting that can cause damage to your eyes over time. When using an external monitor, adjust the brightness and contrast levels to be comfortable for your eyes. If your gaming environment is too dark, it can cause eye strain and headaches. More importantly, too much blue light from the screen can damage your eyes.

### Take Breaks Throughout Gaming Sessions

The easiest way to protect your eyes while gaming is to ensure you take frequent breaks. Try not to play for more than two hours at a time, and bring about 15-minute intervals between sessions. This will allow your eyes to rest and adjust, preventing fatigue from long gaming sessions. On many occasions, gamers can lose track of time while playing and end up sitting in the same position for hours. Make sure you’re taking breaks throughout your gaming sessions to ensure your eyes are adequately rested. Furthermore, ensure to look away from the screen every once in a while so you can focus on different objects in your surroundings.

### Use Protective Eyewear When Necessary

If you’re a serious gamer, consider investing in protective eyewear designed for gamers. As mentioned by the folks at [blockbluelight.com.au](https://www.blockbluelight.com.au/), many gaming glasses come with blue light protection that can help reduce the strain on your eyes over long periods. They also come with tinted lenses that help block out additional glare from the screen. It may be a good idea to talk to your eye doctor about what type of eyewear is best for you and your gaming habits. On the other hand, if you don’t want to invest in gaming glasses, consider wearing sunglasses or regular eyeglasses when playing. Protective eyewear of any kind can be beneficial for reducing eyestrain and protecting your eyes from the potential damage of bright screens.

### Think About The Placement Of Your Equipment

From the height of your monitor to the position of your keyboard, the [placement](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-set-up-workspace/) of your gaming setup is just as important as any other part of protecting your eyes. Ensure you’re setting up your equipment to be ergonomically friendly and comfortable for extended game sessions. It is also essential to ensure you’re not putting too much strain on your neck, as this can cause further issues. Moreover, ensure you’re sitting at least an arm’s length away from your monitor. Furthermore, avoid hunching over your keyboard, as this can cause further strain on your neck and eyes. Moreover, take note of your monitor's position and ensure the top is level with your eyes.

### Make Sure You Remain Hydrated

Drinking plenty of water while gaming is essential to keep your eyes hydrated and reduce any potential dryness or fatigue. Dehydration can cause various eye-related issues, such as blurry vision, dry eyes, and headaches. Therefore, ensure you drink enough water throughout the day, especially during extended game sessions. Additionally, if your eyes become dry or irritated while gaming, consider using lubricating eye drops to provide relief. Hydration is not only vital for protecting your eyes, but it can also help you stay alert and focused during gaming sessions.

### Make Sure the Monitor is Leveled with the Eyes

This will help reduce strain on your neck and eye muscles as you won't have to look up or down too much to see the screen. Additionally, try using a monitor with an adjustable stand so that you can easily adjust the height of your screen. The proper positioning of your monitor can help you maintain good posture while gaming and reduce the strain on your neck and eyes. Furthermore, if you don’t have access to an adjustable monitor or stand, consider placing the monitor on a few books, so it is at eye level. Generally speaking, the closer the monitor is to your eyes, the less strain you’ll put on your neck and eyes.

### Look Away From the Screen Every Once in a While

This is another important step for protecting your eyes. Playing video games makes it easy to get lost in the game and remember to take breaks. Make sure you’re looking away from the screen every once in a while so that you can focus on different objects and give your eyes some relief from the screen's bright light. Aim to take a few breaks throughout the day and focus your eyes on something farther away than what you typically look at. This will help reduce eyestrain and keep your eyes healthy and refreshed. Furthermore, things like the 20-20-20 rule (looking away from the screen for 20 seconds every 20 minutes) can be a great way to get in the habit of taking regular breaks throughout your gaming sessions.

### Use Lubricating Eye Drops

If you find your eyes feeling dry or strained, then lubricating eye drops can be a great way to provide relief. Find an eye drop labeled “lubricating” and use it sparingly throughout the day to help keep your eyes moist and comfortable. In addition, make sure you’re drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated and reduce any potential dryness in your eyes. Lubricating eye drops can help reduce any discomfort you may feel while gaming and keep your eyes healthy. More importantly, when buying lubricating eye drops, ensure you’re using ones specifically designed for the eyes and not just any type of oil.

### Set Up Equipment Ergonomically Friendly for Extended Sessions

It’s important to have the right equipment for extended gaming sessions to protect your eyes. Make sure you use ergonomically friendly keyboards, mice, and other gaming peripherals explicitly designed for comfort and support. Also, ensure you’re not putting too much strain on your neck, as this can lead to neck pain and headaches. You may want to consider investing in a gaming chair with adjustable armrests, back support, and lumbar support to be comfortable while gaming for long periods. Finally, ensure you’re not sitting in the same position for too long, as this can be bad for your posture and overall health. Switching positions every once in a while is important for protecting your eyes, neck, and back.

### Get Used To The "Night Light" Mode

Most modern monitors come with a “night light” or “blue light” mode that helps reduce the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. This can help reduce eyestrain, as blue light is known to cause eye fatigue and strain. Be sure to turn on this feature to minimize any potentially harmful blue light from entering your eyes. This will help reduce eye strain and improve sleep quality at night. Furthermore, if you don’t have a “night light” mode on your monitor, consider using blue light-blocking glasses while gaming. However, generally speaking, you should be able to find a monitor with this feature available.

The key to protecting your eyes while gaming is to be proactive and take the necessary steps to ensure you’re not overstraining them. If you take the time to follow the steps outlined in this guide, then you’ll be well on your way toward protecting your eyes and keeping them healthy. Remember, giving yourself regular breaks throughout gaming sessions and adjusting equipment for optimal comfort to reduce eyestrain is important. Furthermore, ensure you’re using lubricating eye drops, getting plenty of rest, and setting up your monitor correctly to create the best environment for gaming. All of these steps will help you on your journey toward protecting your eyes while gaming.
