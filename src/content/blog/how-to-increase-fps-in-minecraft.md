Minecraft is a popular but graphics-intensive video game. Many players may experience frame rate issues and want to know how to increase FPS in Minecraft.

A computer without the proper graphics software won't run anything as well as it can, so it's important to check your hardware. One of the easiest ways to increase Minecraft FPS is to use the in-game menus to increase settings. Mods and servers also help keep the game running smoothly.

Read our guide to learn how to increase FPS in Minecraft and why it matters.

## Understanding FPS

Before learning how to increase FPS, it's important to understand exactly what it is and how it works.

Digital images are displayed in frames, i.e. consecutive images with slight movements in each. [Frame rate](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Improving_frame_rate) measures how fast these frames change.

Low frame rates cause choppy, slideshow-style images while gaming. This is distinct from a similar cause of slowdown [known as lag](https://www.howtogeek.com/142193/htg-explains-why-lag-and-low-fps-arent-the-same-thing/). FPS is a computer-related issue, while lag is caused by overwhelmed or poorly set-up networks.

[Various issues](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360034754032-Minecraft-Java-Edition-is-slow) could lower Minecraft FPS. If the computer you're using doesn't meet minimum system requirements or has out-of-date software or hardware, you'll have slower frame rates.

To see the level of improvement you've added, you need to [be able to monitor FPS](https://www.avg.com/en/signal/9-ways-boost-gaming-rig). Many games and platforms such as Steam have an in-game counter, and compatible tools exist as well. There are also other ways to check your Minecraft FPS in-game. The debug menu shows frame rate, as does the Options screen under Snooper Settings.

Any FPS number lower than 30 indicates that you may be having hardware or software problems that you need to fix.

## How to Increase FPS in Minecraft

Figuring out how to increase FPS in Minecraft is not as difficult as it may sound. There are various methods that anyone can use to increase the performance of not only the game but their system as a whole.

Players should have up-to-date graphics drivers and cards and use in-game menus to optimize their settings. If they still experience Minecraft FPS problems, they may want to consider installing mods or using a dedicated server.

We'll go into each of these methods in more detail, explaining each one and how it can help increase Minecraft FPS.

## Graphics Drivers and Cards

Drivers and graphics cards help everything visual on your computer display properly. If they're not powerful enough or up-to-date, you can even suffer the problem of Minecraft low FPS on a good PC.

To update your graphics driver and card, you first have to find out which version you have installed. Use the Device Manager to check your display adapter on Windows. Go to About This Mac then More Info then Graphics on an Apple computer.

Most modern graphics software automatically asks you to update. If yours doesn't or you have automatic updates turned off, you may have to go to the manufacturer's website to download the latest version.

Since it's a graphics-heavy game, updating graphics drivers and cards is an easy way to increase Minecraft FPS. It helps the computer handle all the visual information you're asking it to display.

## Menus

Dedicated players who want to learn how to increase FPS in Minecraft should familiarize themselves with the menus the game provides for improving performance.

The first important one to know is the debug menu, a way of monitoring your game. Bring it up by pressing F3 to find out all sorts of useful information.

Your game version, current FPS, and recent chunk updates are in the top left. These numbers can be correlated, as high chunk numbers usually lead to Minecraft low FPS.

Another important menu is the video settings menu. Press escape and go to Options then Video Settings to open it. Then you can check to ensure your game is using the best video settings possible.

## Settings

Most modern games have settings that users can change to improve performance. Picking the right ones is another way to combat issues with Minecraft low FPS.

Some settings [need to be lowered](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-optimize-minecraft-windows-10-edition-settings-slow-pc) for better performance. These include render distance, anti-aliasing, and particle render distance.

Some settings are unnecessary and use up more computer power than they're worth. Turn off texel anti-aliasing, fancy graphics, and fancy leaves to further increase Minecraft FPS. It's also [useful to turn off](https://pcgamingguide.com/how-to-increase-fps-in-minecraft) video settings like biome blend, smooth lighting, use v-sync, mipmap levels, view bobbing, clouds, and entity shadows,

There are other important settings to be aware of as well. For the best possible FPS, set graphics to fast, max framerate to 60, and particles to minimal.

## Mods

There are mods specifically designed to improve Minecraft performance. Downloading and installing them can help increase Minecraft FPS.

The [BetterFPS Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfps) was made with this purpose in mind. Created by someone who clearly knows how to speed up Minecraft, it has performance-enhancing options like turning off fog and preallocating memory. It also speeds up hoppers, searching, beacons, and more.

The [OptiFine HD FPS Boost Mod](https://www.minecraftxl.com/optifine-hd-mod) supports HD textures. It also allows you to customize a range of settings, allowing for a smoother experience.

## Using a Server

Even if your FPS is as high as it can go and your computer has the best possible hardware, you can still experience Minecraft low FPS on a good PC. If nothing else helps, it could be an issue related to lag, which is something a proper server can help with.

A server is a dedicated place to play a game with other people. They're run by experts who optimize them for performance, avoiding most FPS and lag issues.
