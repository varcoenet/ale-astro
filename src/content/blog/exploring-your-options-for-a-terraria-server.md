Terraria may have been first released in 2011, but it continues to see [thousands of players](https://steamplayercount.com/app/105600) each month. This beloved classic provides endless possibilities, allowing people to create complex worlds, explore, fight, and more.

Of course, it's always more fun to invite your friends to join, which means you'll need to set up a Terraria server. You have a few options available if that's what you want to do. You can host a server yourself or use a dedicated server provider.

Here's what you need to know about the different types of servers and how to set one up.

## Host a Server From Your Computer

If you're only interested in online co-op games or in-home LAN, the Host & Play option works fine.

You can set up a Terraria server hosted via your computer, and friends can join using your IP address. This is a feature that the game supports without any third-party software necessary. You won't need to download anything to get it to work.

You need basic computer skills to do this, as you'll have to set up port forwarding on your PC. Here's what you'll need to get started:

- Terraria installed on your computer
- Public IP address
- IPv4 address
- Router login name and password

Using your computer's command prompt, you can find the [default gateway](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/default-gateway#:~:text=The%20default%20gateway%20is%20the,have%20destinations%20outside%20your%20network.). You can also find your IPv4 address, which you'll need later.

Type the default gateway into the address bar on your browser. This will bring up a login screen. Use the default username and password provided, or use the one you've created (if you changed it.)

Find the section on port forwarding. The location or wording may vary slightly depending on the brand of router you use. From here, you can add a virtual server.

At this point, you can add the private IP address (IPv4) and the port numbers. The default port number is 7777.

There are some issues with this method. For one, security software such as Windows Defender Firewall can block other players from joining. However, you can turn this feature off; remember to turn it back on later.

Provide your friends with your IP address so they can join the game.

**Important Note:** Giving your IP address out can put you at risk. Cybercriminals can use your IP address to find sensitive information, steal your identity, or hack your device. Be very careful if you choose to give this number to others.

Launch TerrariaServer.exe and activate port forwarding. You can launch the world by selecting "Multiplayer" and "Join via IP".

## Get a Dedicated Terraria Server

There are several reasons someone may not want to host a server on their computer. For one, it risks their information and opens up the possibility of being hacked. For another, it requires some technical skills and making a mistake can result in frustrating troubleshooting.

Also, when you host a game from your computer, the server only remains up while your server window is open.

So, what if you want to host a game without putting your information at risk and without any technical skills?

If you want to keep your game running, you plan on using mods, or you're interested in making the most of the game without worrying about internet connection or equipment, you'll need a dedicated server. [Renting a server](https://aleforge.net/gameservers) is the best solution, as you receive everything you need to run the game for a small monthly fee.
