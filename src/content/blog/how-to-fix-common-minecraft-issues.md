In the wake of the year 2023, Minecraft took to its Twitter handle to hear from its audience. The [sandbox game](https://blog.acer.com/en/discussion/213/what-are-sandbox-games?utm_source=community&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=comm_rss) giant asked its audience about their Minecraft-related new year resolutions. While some want to build, others want to mine, among many other plans. The gaming world has taken a different turn since the advent of video games like Minecraft, Roblox, Terraria, etc. Minecraft allows its players to explore, modify the gaming environment, and achieve certain goals without any Minecraft issues.

However, gamers still meet with different Minecraft issues as they explore the virtual gaming environment. These issues could be at the account login stage or while launching the video game on your PC. Therefore, this blog post will provide practical solutions to fixing some issues with Minecraft.

## How to Fix Login Issues on Minecraft

Login issues could result from different factors. One, you might have entered the wrong username (or email) and (or) password. It could even be due to internet connection issues. To fix this;

1\. Check your username or email and password to see if it's correct. If you forget your password, click "I Forgot my Password" to reset it.

2\. Check your internet connection if you still can't log in after resetting your password. If the internet is slow or bad when logging in, try to log in later.

3\. Verify if Minecraft services are unavailable. If this is the case, the login issue is no longer from your end. So, wait till the company resolves it.

4\. Once you ascertain point 3, be on the watch for service updates. The company will inform you about their efforts to get their services back on again.

5\. Once you receive information that Minecraft has resolved their issues but still can't log in, contact their support team.

## How to Fix Minecraft Latency Issues

Lag issues can lead to frustration. There is a lag when the video game receives or processes commands late. The first step to tackling lag issues is meeting the minimum and recommended system requirements. We shall discuss these requirements shortly. However, let's outline the different ways you can tackle this issue. Look through and choose which one suits your lag issue.

### 1\. Boost your Internet Connection

When your internet connection is slow, your Minecraft game will have latency issues. So, you need to speed up your internet connection to take care of this issue. To do this, ensure you are not far away from your router. The distance between you and your router will determine its signal strength. Therefore, the closer, the better. You could even change the router's position. This can help it to receive better signals and improve its speed.

Check the number of users currently connected to your router. Take your mind off the hundreds of devices a router claims to accommodate simultaneously. Having many users connected at once will affect your internet speed. Imagine you are trying to play Minecraft, and another user is attending a virtual class using the same router. So, mind the number of users on your router and their internet activities.

In addition, improve latency issues on Minecraft by updating your network driver. You can either update it manually or automatically. We recommend the automatic update because it is faster and covers every aspect of the updating process. To do this, click 'Update All' to download and install the correct version.

To update manually, download and install ‘Driver Easy.’ Once installed, run it and click ‘Scan Now.’ Click ‘Update’ to automatically download the correct version of the driver while you install it manually.

### 2\. Check your RAM

You need to ensure that you have compatible RAM on your device. Without this, it will be impossible to play Minecraft smoothly. These RAM requirements are in two groups - the RAM you should at least have (minimum) and the ideal (recommended) one.

The minimum and ideal requirements for an operating system should be at least Windows 7 and 10 (64-bit), respectively. Also, your CPU should be at least Intel Core i3-3210 3.2 GHz / AMD A8-7600 APU 3.1 GHz or equivalent. The recommended CPU is an Intel Core i5 4690 | AMD A10 7800 or equivalent.

Similarly, have a minimum Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) of Intel HD Graphics 4000 or AMD Radeon R5 series | NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series or AMD Radeon HD 7000 series. The recommended GPU is NVIDIA GeForce 700 Series | AMD Radeon Rx 200 Series.

Speaking of the Hard Disk Drive (HDD), get a minimum of 1 gigabyte of space. On the other hand, have a 4 gigabytes SSD (Solid State Drive). The memory for your device should be at least 4 gigabytes, while the ideal memory is 8 gigabytes.

### 3\. Adjust Video Settings

Lag issues with Minecraft can stem from high video settings. Therefore, you need to adjust it. Resist the urge to set your video settings too high just to get clean pictures in the video game. Set the video display moderately to improve your Minecraft speed.

To adjust your video settings, launch Minecraft. Once it launches, tap ‘Options.’ Then select ‘Video Settings’ from the different options on the screen. When the video settings pop up, turn ‘Graphics,’ ‘Smooth Lighting,’ and ‘3D Anaglyph’ off. Also, reduce ‘Max Framerate’ and turn off ‘Use Vsync,’ ‘View Bobbing,’ and ‘Clouds.’ After making these changes, click ’Done,’ and relaunch the game.

### 4\. Change Java Priority Settings

Changing Java priority settings is another effective way to fix Minecraft issues related to latency. Minecraft was written in Java. Therefore, it needs to run in the same language. To adjust the language's priority settings on your device, press 'Ctrl,' 'Shift,' and 'Esc' simultaneously. This will open the task manager. When open, click 'Details.' You'll see all priority options - realtime, high, above normal, normal, below normal, and low. Select 'high.'

### 5\. Close Unused Apps

Ensure you do not leave numerous apps and tabs open on your device simultaneously. Always close unused apps and tabs to improve your device's speed. Press 'Ctrl,' 'Shift,' and 'Esc' together to open the task manager. Once open, click the programs you want to close and click 'End Task.'

### 6\. Clean up Disk

Clean up your disk to free up more space on your hard drive. This process helps you eliminate old and no longer needed files, thereby improving your device’s processing speed. To clean your disk, open the search bar on your computer, type ‘disk cleanup,’ and press ‘Enter.’ Next, select the files you want to delete from your device and click ‘Clean up system files.’ Click ‘Ok’ to finalize the cleanup.
