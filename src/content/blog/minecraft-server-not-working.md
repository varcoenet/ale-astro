So, you're getting ready to get into a Minecraft server, and you're prepared to enter the Nether and slay Zoglin and Hoglin and avoid Nether skeletons.

There's only one problem.

When entering the game, you get the dreadedÂ prompt that says "failed to connect to the server" when entering the server. Minecraft server errors can vary from different problems that require other solutions. If you're having problems getting into the game, this article is for you.

This article will go over the problems and solutions when you get a prompt that says, "Minecraft server not working."

## Free up Bandwidth

The reason you're getting a "cannot connect to server" prompt could be there's not enough bandwidth available on your network for the game to launch. If you have a dual-band router with 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks. Put all your devices on the 2.4ghz network and save your Minecraft device for the 5ghz network.

You can also disable the WIFI on devices that aren't being used, which will help free up some bandwidth.

## Get Out of the Game

One of the best ways to do a soft reset is by simply getting out of your game without logging out and trying to get back into the game. This will reset your network's communication and the [game server](https://aleforge.net/blog/7-major-benefits-of-having-your-own-game-server) and hopefully get you back to your desired server.

## Disable Your Firewall

Your computer's Firewall is a network security device that tracks network traffic and blocks communication that it sees as a security threat. When you play a game of Minecraft, the server communicates with your computer. If your firewall configuration is set too high, it may see the server as a threat and block the game.

You can do this by going to "system settings." Click on Windows Defender Firewall and turn it off. Be aware that turning off your Firewall can leave you defenseless against harmful malware or spyware.

Make sure your Firewall is set to the recommended settings that work with gaming. Doing this will get you back into the server.

## Sign Out of Your Account

If you can't get into the server, you may need to refresh the connection and authentication. Try signing out of your account entirely and get back into it by logging in with your credentials.

## Reset Your Network

If you're still asking yourself, "why is my Minecraft server down," another solution you can try to [reset your network](https://www.homenethowto.com/basics/introduction-home-networks/) if you still can't get in. You can do this three ways.

### Airplane Mode

Disconnect your computer to the network by going into airplane mode. This will kill all network connections, then disable airplane mode.

### Network Adapter Reset

Reset your [network adapter](https://www.howtogeek.com/764894/what-is-a-network-adapter/). You can do this by going into your computer's device manager. Scroll down in the device manager and click on "network adapters." Left-click on your Wifi connection and scan for hardware changes.

### Power Cycle Network Hardware

Lastly, you can unplug your network's modem and router, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in. This will reset your network and hopefully get you back into the game.

## Update Your Drivers

Sometimes you'll need to update your network drivers if you can't connect to the game server. You can try to update your network drivers. The process is similar to resetting your network adapter.

First, you'll want to go to "network devices." Scroll down and click on "network adapters." Right-click on your network's Wifi and click "update drivers." Your computer will scan and update your drivers, or you can choose to update your drivers.

## Restart Your Computer

Your computer itself may be preventing you from getting in-game. This could be as simple as updating your operating software or other necessary software. You can do this by checking your computer if it needs updates. Go to your system settings and click on "check for updates." A list of updates may be available, which you'll need to install.

Once installed, restart your computer, and it should automatically update. Once your computer is updated, try getting back in the Minecraft server.

## Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)

There could be an issue with your [internet service provider](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/isp.asp) (ISP) that's holding you up. Your ISP could be blocking the server for several reasons. The ISP could think that the content is malicious, or it could be blocked for other reasons such as using a school laptop or work computer.

The only way to get around this is by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN will disguise your IP address and change your location to have a private and secure network. A paid VPN service is suggested since they guarantee faster speeds and better security. A [customizable host server](https://aleforge.net/games/minecraft) may also help as well.

## Check to See if Mojang Servers are Down

The solution to your server problems might be pretty straightforward. Do a quick google search to see if Mojang servers are down. Sometimes, the Minecraft server list is updating or going through maintenance downtime.

The Mojang website should give you information if the servers are down, preventing you from connecting to the servers.
