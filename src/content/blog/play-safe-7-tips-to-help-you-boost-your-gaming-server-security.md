If you're one of the [150 million Americans](https://www.theesa.com/resource/2022-essential-facts-about-the-video-game-industry) who play video games regularly, you probably know the stress of worrying about hackers coming into your server and the fear of them ruining all your hard work.

You've probably asked yourself: how do I keep my gaming server safe from cyber-attacks? How do I make sure I have good game server security? Well, this article is here to give you seven handy tips to help you answer this question.

So read this article for an extra life!

## 1\. Choose The Right Game Server

One way to make sure that your server is safe it to choose the right server in the first place. Having a [private gaming server](https://aleforge.net/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-game-server-hosting) can keep your server safe from pesky hackers who might try to get your information.

With a private server, you'll have much higher reliability. This will build in the security features and support you need to have a stress-free gaming experience.

## 2\. Do Your Research

We get it: gaming isn't exactly the highest paying job for most people, and you're probably wondering how you're even going to fund the security measures you need. The good news is that budget servers offer [most of the same features](../gameservers) as premium servers do... and at a much lower price.

Even if you choose not to go with a private gaming server, there are other cheap options for having network security servers and game security. Sometimes these packages even come with more features that will make your gaming experience even richer. Do your research and keep an eye out for good things when they pop up!

## 3\. Understand How DDoS Attacks Work

Hackers might launch distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on servers for extortion, revenge, or just because they think it's fun. Sadly, since the bad effects of a DDoS attack range from sluggish service to loss of software altogether, they aren't going to be anywhere near as fun for you.

There are also many different kinds of DDoS attacks, a couple of the most common ones being volume-based and protocol-based hackings. All DDoS attacks have one thing in common, though- your information and software isn't only your information and software anymore.

So you might be wondering: how can I stay safe against people who do bad things for bad reasons? Well, fortunately, it's easy to learn what [tools DDoS attackers use](https://www.greycampus.com/blog/information-security/dos-attacks-tools-and-protection) for most of their hacks. Once you know what you're up against, you can figure out what tools will be best to fight these breaches to your system.

## 4\. Understand Why You're Vulnerable

A big reason that people's servers are hacked is that they don't understand why their servers are open to DDoS attacks in the first place. Hackers and defenders are in an [ongoing battle](https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/13/why-the-game-industry-is-still-vulnerable-to-distributed-denial-of-service-attacks) to see who can use gaming technologies best to help their own interests.

Advancements in technology make it hard for defense systems to keep up with new ways that hackers are coming up with to breach server firewalls and gather information. So, you'll need to understand what these hackers are doing. This is how you can make sure your security features measure up.

## 5\. Encrypting Boosts Server Security

Encrypting your data will help any information to become secure by giving you more authority over the data that you're using. It also gives you ultimate knowledge of the codes you use to encrypt. Gaming server security is no different - in fact, encrypting your gaming servers is one of the single best ways to make sure that no one you don't want in is going to get in.

There's encrypting technology that's compatible with all sorts of gaming servers. There are encrypting root tools that can be used on [whatever root program](https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs) you prefer - Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla being just a few on the list.

## 6\. Establish A VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Now, we know what you're thinking. A VPN? For gaming? I've never heard of that! Well, whether you knew about them or not, they exist, and they're a great tool to rout your traffic quickly through a server.

DDoS attacks are on the rise, and a VPN gives you extra armor against the attacks that might be launched at you when you least expect it. VPNs will give you more control over the sites that you visit. They will also give you more access to help and support if something does happen.

There are [different types of VPN](https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-gaming-vpn) apps depending on what gaming platform you're using. If you like speed more than anything else, think of getting VyprVPN. Even though all VPNs help security, NordVPN might be for you if protection is your number one goal.

For mobile gaming, try ExpressVPN is what you should get. No matter how you like to game, a VPN app will have your back.

## 7\. Try Not To Over-Stress

Above all, gaming is supposed to be fun, and if you take precautions to make sure DDoS attacks don't happen, they probably won't. You have to power to make DDoS attacks less likely and should feel pretty good if you install software to combat these problems.

Besides, you know games, and so you know that if you can see your enemy's next move, you can plan for what happens before a cyber attack. So in this way, you've been preparing yourself to fight against hackers far longer than the hackers have been preparing to go up against the big boss: you.

Now that you understand how DDoS hacking works and have some tools on your sidebar to beat them, you might want to check out a [handy free trial](../gameservers) for Grade A software and helpful tech support.

Now go out there and rest assured that while you win the boss battles onscreen, other people and server security systems will be worrying about your real-life boss battles for you!
