This article will delve into some tips and tricks to help you get your server up and running.

## 1\. Tips to Start a Minecraft Server

If you want to start a private Minecraft server, you have a few options. You can make a server yourself with a great high-spec computer, or you can also use a server rental for a plug-and-play option.

Both have their pros and cons. Let's get into them!

### Set Up Your PC as a Host

You can set up your home PC as a server. To do this, you'll need a pretty beefy computer, depending on how many friends you want to add.

To run a [game server](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/server) from your PC, you'll want it to be dedicated to that task alone. If you have set up your home PC as a server, you may experience lag issues or server crashes.

You will also need a very fast internet connection. We're talking a minimum of 12 MBps.

If you want to host your Minecraft server, purchasing a dedicated PC for this task would be recommended. Buying a new PC might not be in your budget, though, if you want a more cost-effective solution, renting a server might be the way to go.

### Rent a Server 

You may not realize you can rent a private and dedicated game server for you and your friends.

When you rent a server, it takes all of the complicated configurations out of your hands. You don't have to worry if your PC is up to spec or how fast your internet connection is. These servers are top-notch and will run your server with little to no issue.

Renting a server makes it easy to scale if you add more players. They also come with DDoS protection, something you may not be able to do on your own.

## 3\. Troubleshooting Your Minecraft Server

When things go wrong, it can be frustrating to figure out what the problem is. If you are running your own server, there is an extensive checklist to determine the issue.

### If You Are Running a Home Server

First, you'll want to determine if your issue is PC-related or not. You can run your repair tool to rule this out.

Once you have ruled out PC-related issues, you'll need to try and narrow down what your server problem might be even further. If it is game-specific and you can't connect, you could be running outdated server hardware. Check to see if there is a newer version available and install that.

If that doesn't work, try disabling your firewall or your antivirus software. Sometimes this can cause issues.

The next step is to sign in and out of your Minecraft account, quit, and restart. Sometimes this is what the system needs to get going again.

If you are still having issues, you can try resetting your modem as a last resort.

Problems can also be a result of whatever third-party mods or software you have downloaded. Double-check to make sure everything you downloaded for your server is up to date.

Most of the above steps will help get your Minecraft server going again. If there are still issues after all of that, you can check forums like Reddit for an answer.
