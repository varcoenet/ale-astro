## Introduction

Contrary to its appearance, Minecraft includes some subtle RPG elements. One of the ways the game aims to enhance your character's abilities is through enchanting. Enchanting allows you to strengthen your items or imbue them with unique properties. For instance, enchantments can bolster its durability if you're fond of the aesthetic of your current armor but find it lacking in defense against formidable foes. Similarly, trying out enchantments is worth considering if you desire a sword that deals more damage and inflicts special effects in exciting new ways.

The enchanting process can be intricate, and there are various methods to achieve it. This guide will provide a step-by-step walkthrough and explain this mechanic in detail.

## Enchanting in Minecraft

### What Can Be Enchanted

Enchantments can only be applied to items that are part of your permanent inventory and regularly used, such as tools, weapons, and armor. Consumable items like fruits cannot be enchanted. Only those with multiple uses that will last for an extended period.

Enchanting an item is intended to enhance its usefulness. Still, it can be a time-consuming process that requires some sacrifices on your part. Whether it's giving up resources to create an enchantment or putting in the effort to activate it, a sense of investment is involved. That being said, it would make little sense to be able to enchant consumable items.

You can use several methods to create an enchantment for a specific item.

The simplest way is to acquire an already enchanted item. Villagers are an excellent source of enchanted items, especially if you're willing to trade some emeralds. Alternatively, while fishing, enchanted items can be discovered. You might also stumble upon them in chests scattered throughout the world. Lastly, defeating enemies carrying enchanted weapons might grant you their enchanted items.

You can also create your own enchanted items, which we'll focus on in this article. Let's explore how Minecraft provides more options for crafting enchanted items than other games.

Suppose you have an item without any enchantments. In that case, you can bring it to an enchantment table and use your experience points and lapis lazuli to add enchantments. Remember that this method will only work on items with existing enchantments. It's one of the easiest ways to obtain an enchanted item early in the game because it doesn't require extensive exploration or rely heavily on chance.

Another option is to utilize an anvil, which allows you to combine multiple enchanted items and create a new item with all the combined enchantments. However, obtaining multiple enchanted items may take a considerable amount of time playing the game.

Additionally, you can use an anvil to merge a regular tool, weapon, or armor with an enchanted book. This process will consume some of your experience points for creating the enchantment. It's worth noting that if you're playing in Creative mode, no experience points are required.

Lastly, there is a cheat method where you can use the console command "/enchant" to instantly apply any desired enchantment without fulfilling any other requirements. However, even if you use cheats, your abilities remain limited to enchanting tools, weapons, and armor.

### Crafting an Enchanting Table

Most players opt for enchantment tables to create enchanted items. Let us guide you on how to craft one. In Creative mode, the enchantment table can already be found in your inventory. Depending on the game version, it might be listed under Miscellaneous, Decorations, or Items.

To create an enchanting table, you'll need a book, four obsidian blocks, and two diamonds. Additionally, ensure that you have a crafting table available. This will allow you to access a 3x3 grid in the crafting menu. Once at the crafting table, expand the grid in the crafting menu sufficiently to accommodate building the enchanting table.

It's crucial to place the items correctly on the crafting grid for successful creation. Otherwise, your attempts at crafting will yield no results.

Position the book on top of the grid in its own row. To set up the enchanting table, arrange the second row with a diamond, obsidian, and another diamond in that specific order. The third row should be filled entirely with obsidian. Once you've done this, the enchanting table will appear, and you can move it to your inventory screen to start using it.

In addition to picking your race, you'll also have the opportunity to select from a range of classes. Classes include blademaster, warlock, gunslinger, and hydromancer. Races and classes can be combined, just adding to the varied playthroughs you can enjoy with this mod.

Arcania RPG uses other existing mods as its base. Before enjoying the map and everything it has to offer, you will need to install the Chad's Furniture-and-More and Thorium mods, then download the Arcania RPG files from Nexus.

### Using the Enchantment Table

Now that we've covered some basic concepts of item enchantment let's see how we can put the enchanting table into action. You'll need to place it in your game world to use it. We recommend finding a safe and open area away from any potential threats. If you're playing in Creative mode, this won't be an issue, but it's best to secure your enchanting table indoors if enemies are present in your game mode.

You can position your enchanting table wherever you like within the game world. However, ensure that there is ample space around it so that you can surround it with bookshelves. These bookshelves are crucial because they determine which enchantments are available for use through enchanted books. When you obtain some enchanted books, place them on these bookshelves so they can be accessed whenever needed. This will expand the capacity of your inventory and provide you with more room to work while conveniently placing the enchantment books next to the enchanting table.

Around your enchantment table, you can position a maximum of 15 bookshelves. The game will recognize these available enchantments. However, if you have more than 15 bookshelves nearby, the game will not acknowledge them as accessible. It only accepts the first 15 enchantments that are available. If you wish to store additional enchantments, we recommend creating another enchanting table and filling it with bookshelves. This can serve as your overflow table.

### Enchanting Items using the table

Once all the equipment for enchanting is in place, using it to enchant an item is relatively straightforward. You'll need to decide which item you want to enchant â€“ whether it's a sword, bow, boots, book, or any other eligible item. Please remember that only tools, weapons, and armor can be enchanted. Also, remember that it's best to choose items you intend to use and would benefit from an enchantment. Avoid wasting your valuable enchantments on items where they wouldn't make sense. There aren't many limitations on how you can perform enchantments, so ensure that the enchantments you choose align with your playstyle and make sense to you.

To begin the enchanting process, approach the enchanting table and access it from your inventory. This will open up the enchanting menu, which consists of two boxes on the left and three slots on the right. The boxes are meant for placing the item you want to enchant and lapis lazuli. If you're in Creative Mode, there's no need for lapis lazuli. However, if not, you'll require one to three of them to make the magic happen. For instance, a sword would need three lapis lazuli.

The slots in the enchanting menu are where you select which enchantment to use. Each enchantment is locked behind a specific experience level requirement. You might have an enchantment in mind, but if your experience level doesn't meet that requirement, you won't be able to use it. As expected, higher experience points are needed for more powerful and valuable enchantments.

If there's a particular enchantment you desire but lack enough power at present, keep playing the game and gaining experience. If you ever need to enchant an item, you can always come back to the enchantment table later when you feel ready. This way, you can choose the specific item on which you want to use the enchantment.

Before heading to the enchanting table to perform a magical upgrade on an item, make sure you have a particular item in mind that you wish to enchant. If you're not satisfied with the enchantment placed on an item, there's a way to remove it by repairing it. For this, you'll need two identical items, and one of them will disappear after the process but without any remaining enchantments. Therefore, it's essential to be sure about wanting that particular enchantment removed before proceeding with this procedure.
