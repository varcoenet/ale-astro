# Modding with tModLoader

Did you know that Terraria has sold more than [44 million copies](https://levvvel.com/terraria-statistics/)? There is so much fun to be had in the world of Terraria. But playing Terraria with mods can provide hours of extra fun. Let's take a look at some of the best mods and find out more about how to use them.

## tModLoader, a Terraria modding API

tModLoader is one of the most popular modding APIs for Terraria. This free modding tool allows you to download and update the mods of your choice. It's easy to use and has a range of different features for players and developers alike.

This modding software is developed and maintained by a dedicated team. tModLoader is regularly updated with new features and performance enhancements. It's worth keeping track of the latest version of the Terraria modding API to ensure you're not missing out.

### Types of Mods

There are two key types of mods for Terraria. The most commonly used mods are integrated into tModLoader. There are a great range of these mods available thanks to the ease of coding mods through the program. They are also easier to run and have more support options available.

The other type of mod is the standalone. Standalone mods are loaded separately from the core game and won't run through tModLoader. Although these types of mods are rarer, they offer a greater variety of styles and gameplay options due to a lack of constraints from APIs.

## Installing the Latest Terraria tModLoader

It's straightforward to download and install tModLoader, although the process is slightly different depending on how you play Terraria. If you play on Steam, you can download tModLoader on Steam directly.

### Running 1.3

Follow these simple steps to run version 1.3 of the tModLoader.

- Go to Steam and find tModLoader
- Right-click on the program and select "properties"
- Choose "BETAS"
- Go to the top menu and select "1.3-legacy" from the drop-down menu

And then you're good to go! If you need extra help or experience any unforeseen errors, you can find solutions on the tModLoader site or various fan communities.

### 1.4 Launch Errors

1.4 sometimes fails to load, due to a few minor bugs. The tModLoader GitHub website features a range of bug reports with solutions for each problem detailed there.

Linux users may find that tModLoader fails to run when loaded through Steam. This can be easily fixed by running tModLoader directly. After this has been done once, you should be able to load the program through Steam.

## Manual Installation Process

If you play the GOG version of Terraria or want to use a specific version of the program, you will need to manually install tModLoader. To do this, you will need to download a tModLoader file from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/releases).

Version 1.4.4 is the most recent edition of the program, and can be found at the top of the page. If you want a version 1.4.3 or a version 1.4.4-preview installation, simply search on the releases page for the most recent release. Note that version 1.4.4-preview is regularly updated - you'll have to re-download it if you want to benefit from these changes.

Version 1.3 can be [found here](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/releases/tag/v0.11.8.9) - simply pick the right file for your operating system. Different versions are available for Windows, Linux, and various other systems.

Once you've downloaded your chosen version, simply unzip the files to the Terraria installation folder, and it'll be ready to go.

### Support

Support is available if you are having trouble with tModLoader. The Terraria community forums are the best place to go when you run into trouble. There are plenty of existing threads there documenting existing problems, and you can use the search function at the top of the page to find key terms.

tModLoader functions like an API for those looking to design their own mods. It makes the game's tricky source code a little easier.
