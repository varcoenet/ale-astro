Although this game is known for its elements that require resource management and critical thinking, it can become a bit stale over time if you only play the vanilla version. The good news is that it’s possible to use Factorio mods to help enhance your experience.</p>\n<p>However, not everybody understands how to add them to a Factorio server. Let’s take a look at everything you need to know so that you can take your gaming sessions to the next level.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-benefits-of-using-mods\">What Are the Benefits of Using Mods?</h2>\n<p>There are quite a few benefits that come with using mods in Factorio. For one, they can help to improve the overall gameplay experience.</p>\n<p>This is because mods can add new features and content to the game. Additionally, they can also help to make the game more challenging, which can be great for those who are looking for something more difficult than vanilla content.</p>\n<p>Mods can also help to improve the visuals of the game. This is especially true for those who are looking for a more immersive experience.</p>\n<p>Some mods provide such a difficulty spike that even seasoned players find the challenge overwhelming at first. It’s worth noting that you can use mods to help create a personalized experience when playing the game.</p>\n<p>For example, many different texture packs can reskin certain elements of the game to look like something else. A common resource that texture packs draw from includes movies, other video games, etc.</p>\n<p>Keep this in mind when searching for mods to add to your server. Even a simple change in appearance could make the game feel much fresher.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-install-mods\">How Do You Install Mods?</h2>\n<p>Installing mods in Factorio is a pretty simple process. The first thing that you need to do is find the mod that you want to use.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to download the files for the mod. After that, you’ll need to extract the files to your Factorio directory.</p>\n<p>After the files have been extracted, you’ll need to launch the game. From there, you’ll need to go to the “Mods” menu and enable the mods that you want to use.</p>\n<p>Finally, you’ll be able to enjoy all of the benefits that come with using mods in Factorio.</p>\n<p>However, there are certain mistakes you need to avoid that people commonly make. One of the most prominent is extracting the mods to the wrong folder. Not only will this prevent you from using the mods correctly, but it can also interfere with other game files.</p>\n<p>In some cases, doing so could cause a game to crash upon start-up. In a situation like this, you may be forced to uninstall and then reinstall the game. Another mistake that people make is not checking the compatibility notes of the mod they download.</p>\n<p>Some mods do not work with certain versions of Factorio. Running the wrong mods could impact the integrity of your saved data, so use caution. You should also keep in mind that the installation instructions are often different depending on what operating system you use for your device.</p>\n<p>To clarify, Windows and Mac users will need to follow different steps to ensure they install the mods correctly. Be sure that you read the insulation instructions carefully so you avoid potential issues with your game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-best-mods\">What Are the Best Mods?</h2>\n<p>There are a ton of great mods out there for Factorio. This means that you shouldn’t have a problem finding one that is best for you. Let’s take a look at some of the most notable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"farl\">FARL</h3>\n<p>This mod adds a new layer of strategy to the game by allowing you to build railways that can be used to transport resources. However, you must maintain these railways as the game goes on.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you could find yourself at a significant disadvantage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"logistic-train-network\">Logistic Train Network</h3>\n<p>This mod allows you to create a more efficient transportation system for your resources. This is mostly a quality-of-life update. It aims to make the game more pleasant to play overall.</p>\n<h3 id=\"air-transport\">Air Transport</h3>\n<p>This mod adds a new way to transport resources via aircraft.</p>\n<p>Similar to the Logistics Train Network mod, Air Transport establishes an additional method for resource transportation. It comes complete with its own mechanics, such as build requirements, maximum radius, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"better-ironsight\">Better Ironsight</h3>\n<p>This mod improves the accuracy of your weapons. It’s no secret that using weapons with low accuracy can easily become frustrating. Fortunately, Better Ironsight patches this up quite nicely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"nuclear-power\">Nuclear Power</h3>\n<p>This mod allows you to harness the power of nuclear energy. As you might guess, this is one of the most entertaining on this list.</p>\n<p>Nuclear energy comes with a wide range of mechanics, and it can be used as a powerful resource for your factories.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-should-i-look-for-mods\">Where Should I Look For Mods?</h2>\n<p>There are many different online resources you can tap into. However, you need to avoid shady websites at all costs.
