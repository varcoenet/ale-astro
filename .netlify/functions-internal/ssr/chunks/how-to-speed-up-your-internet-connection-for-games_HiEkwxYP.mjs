If you're stuck with a slow connection, you can do a few things to speed it up and get back to your gaming fun. Check out the top tips listed below.\n\n### Check Your Internet Speed and See Where You Stand\n\nHave you ever felt like your internet could have been faster? Checking your internet speed is the best way to get the most from your connection. Testing your speed makes it easy to see where you stand and make informed decisions about how best to adjust the settings for a better online experience. Most [modems](https://www.mwave.com.au/wireless-networking/modems-routers-gateways-wireless) with an internet connection include their built-in speed test, so you can quickly check your speeds and make sure everything is good to go. After all, understanding and managing your internet speed ensures that you're always up-to-date with the latest technology and can stay connected in today's digital world.\n\n### Update Your Router's Firmware\n\nKeeping your router's firmware up-to-date is one of the best ways to ensure you have the latest security and performance enhancements. Newer firmware versions offer better functionality, such as improved compatibility with specific devices, more available parental control options, and enhanced security features like default usernames and passwords automatically changed on installation. It can be time-consuming to update your router's firmware manually, but it's worth the effort for extra security and performance benefits. Plus, once the initial setup process is complete, it only takes a few minutes to check for future updates. Don't let outdated hardware put your data at risk. Always stay on top of new firmware releases to ensure you're fully protected from cyber threats.\n\n### Connect to Your Router Using an Ethernet Cable Instead of Wi-Fi\n\nConnecting your router using an Ethernet cable is one of the best ways to ensure a robust and reliable connection. An [Ethernet cable](https://www.techradar.com/news/networking/powerline-networking-what-you-need-to-know-930691) removes any potential interference from other networks, providing a consistent and unwavering link that can help with downloading, streaming, gaming, and more. Moreover, the physical connection between you and your router offers incredibly secure communication that thieves and malicious actors can't compromise. Installing an Ethernet cable requires drilling or wiring but once in place provides years of trouble-free use. An Ethernet connection is worth considering if you're looking for clear sound and reliable data transmission.\n\n### Place Your Router in a Central Location in Your Home for Better Signal Strength.\n\nPlacing your router in an optimal location is essential for strong Wi-Fi signal strength in your home. Combining this with other methods, such as switching to a dual-band router, reducing interference from electronics and appliances, or updating firmware, can help ensure you get the best internet speeds possible. Home Wi-Fi routers perform best when set up centrally with few walls or obstructions blocking their signal. Make sure that your router is in an open and elevated area. If placed too close to floor level, this can cause furniture and other objects to block the signal. Setting up antennas at a 45-degree angle along the wall furthest from your router also helps to increase performance. These tips can help boost your connection speed, so take advantage of them today.\n\n### Reduce the Number of Devices Connected to Your Network\n\nThe internet is convenient and provides access to information, but too many devices using the same home network can slow down your connection. Reducing the number of [devices connected to your network](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-kick-your-kids-off-the-wi-fi) will help you have a faster and more reliable experience. Streamlining your connected devices also helps maintain security â€” with fewer devices connected, it is easier to ensure each one is protected and up-to-date with updates. To reduce the number of devices on your network, try disconnecting ones not being used regularly, such as an old phone or gaming console. It will help you stay secure while giving you a smoother online experience.\n\n### Use a Quality Antivirus Program to Protect Yourself\n\nProtecting your information from cyber-attacks is paramount in the digital age. The best way to guard against malicious software and other cybercrime is to install a quality antivirus program. It should have the latest detection technology and the ability to scan files and provide regular updates, so you are always secure. When choosing an antivirus provider, look for one that offers complete online protection so you can browse the web safely and keep your personal information safe when making online purchases or banking transactions. With reliable anti-malware measures in place, you can trust that you are less vulnerable to malicious attacks from hackers and viruses intent on stealing your private data.\n\nFollowing the tips above, you can troubleshoot a slow internet connection and help improve your overall online experience. These steps allow you to enjoy a faster, more reliable internet connection.\n";
