Even after you've gotten familiar with the details on how the game's mechanics work, there are still plenty of Minecraft easter eggs to discover that many players miss.\n\nNot sure where to start? Don't worry, we’ve got you covered.\n\nLet's take a look at everything you need to know.\n\n## Upside-Down Mobs\n\nBy naming a mob (whether it be a creature, Villager, etc.) 'Dinnerbone,' they'll immediately be flipped upside-down. Despite their appearance, they'll still retain all of their basic functions.\n\nThis means that Skeletons, Zombies, and Creepers can all attack you even though they're inverted!\n\nWhile there isn't much utility to this easter egg, it can be fun to flip all of the mobs in a surrounding area while you build your home.\n\n## Rainbow Sheep\n\nSimilar to the above process, naming a sheep 'jeb\\_' will cause the color of its tool to rapidly transition between colors in the game's palette. The sheep's behavior is otherwise unaffected.\n\nIf you choose to shear the sheep, the wool it drops will be the same color that it was originally. So, renaming a brown sheep to 'jeb\\_' will result in brown wool despite the rainbow appearance.\n\nA humorous way to take advantage of this easter egg is to rename every sheep you see, causing potentially hundreds of rainbow-colored sheep to wander the landscape.\n\n## Missingno Splash Text\n\nThe 'splash text' is the randomized wording displayed alongside 'Minecraft' on the title screen. It often includes inside jokes, hints, and sometimes outlandish phrases.\n\nThese phrases are compiled in a text document called 'splashes.txt' in the game's folder. If this file is deleted, the text on the title screen will be displayed as 'Missingo.'\n\nFor those who are unaware, this is in reference to an [infamous glitch](https://kotaku.com/pokemons-famous-missingno-glitch-explained-1653929141) in the original Pokemon Red & Blue games for the Nintendo Gameboy.\n\nAfter performing a series of very specific actions, players are able to force the game to encounter Pokemon in a setting where it normally wouldn't. although there are many outcomes to this situation, one of the most prominent was encountering a Pokemon named 'MISSINGNO.'\n\nIts appearance was a collection of scrambled pixels organized in an L-shape, and its name was a reference to the fact that no Pokemon was able to be loaded during the encounter.\n\nDespite how interesting the glitch was, it had a high chance of corrupting your save file!\n\n## Naturally-Spawned Charged Creepers\n\nWhile this isn't exactly an explicit easter egg, having this scenario occur on its own is so rare that it may as well be.\n\nIf a Creeper is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm (or if lightning strikes within four blocks of its position), it will become 'charged.'\n\nAesthetically, this is denoted by the addition of a blue aura that surrounds the mob. But, there's another change to keep an eye out for.\n\nCharged Creepers' explosions have roughly double the power as a regular Creeper. But, the explosion radius is approximately 5-6 times larger. This means that having a Charged Creeper detonate near your home will likely destroy most of it if protective measures (such as Obsidian or a moat) aren't in place.\n\nIf you wish to witness a Charged Creeper for yourself, striking one with a Trident that has the 'Channeling' enchantment during a thunderstorm will have the same effect. Just make sure you run as far as you can afterward!\n\n## 'Mineceraft'\n\nThe splash text on the title screen will always change. But, there's a very small chance that the 'Minecraft' text will change, too.\n\nIn fact, there's a 0.01% chance that the title screen will instead read 'Mineceraft.' Since this scenario is so rare, it's worth screenshotting if it happens to you.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that it can be fairly easy to miss, so check the text each time you play!\n\n## Jack Torrance \n\nMost people wouldn't expect there to be a reference to Stephen King's *The Shining* in a game [like Minecraft](https://aleforge.net/blog/how-to-choose-between-minecraft-java-and-bedrock-editions), but a minor (yet particularly brutal) one exists.\n\nThere are mobs called' Vindicators' that always spawn with iron axes. If you renamed one 'Johnny', you'll find that it immediately enters a killing rampage and attacks anything in sight.\n\nThis is a reference to the infamous 'Here's Johnny!' scene in *The Shining.* It involved the main character Jack Torrance exclaiming the iconic phrase will carving through a door with an ax in order to harm his wife and son.\n\nInterestingly, a Vindicator named 'Johnny' will not be hostile toward Ghasts or 'Illagers.'\n\n## 'Toast' The Rabbit\n\nAfter a player allegedly wrote a letter to Mojang asking for their pet rabbit 'Toast' who had recently run away to be added into the game, the developers obliged.\n\nBy naming a rabbit 'Toast,' its color scheme will change to black and white as opposed to the traditional variants. The missing rabbit in question was apparently made up primarily of these two colors.\n\nAlthough it's unknown if the player ever found their pet rabbit again, it's resulted in one of the most heartwarming easter eggs that Minecraft has to offer.\n\n## Finding These Minecraft Easter Eggs On Your Own Can Seem Difficult\n\nBut it doesn't have to be.\n\nWith the above information about these Minecraft easter eggs in mind, you'll be well on your way toward enjoying the game's hidden gems you may not have known about.\n\nWant to learn more about how to increase your FPS while playing Minecraft?
