Do you want to amp up the security of your gaming server or business website?\n\nNo matter how small or large your website, it can always fall victim to a data breach. If you want to ensure your security with your hosting solution, it might be time to switch to VPS hosting.\n\nBefore we go on, let’s define what VPS hosting is. VPS stands for Virtual Private Server, which is a virtualized server for gaming or websites. It is a “smaller” version of a dedicated server.\n\nA VPS has its own disc space, operating system, and bandwidth. In essence, a VPS is a server running within a server. But why use one?\n\nCheck out our list of six key benefits of VPS hosting to consider.\n\n## 1\\. Getting a VPS Hosting Account Is Cost-Effective\n\nIf you own an online retail shop, user experience is very important. The [first 10 seconds](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages) a visitor spends on your page are critical. When high traffic is slowing down your server response times, a good solution is to switch to VPS hosting.\n\nVPS hosting is more powerful and versatile than shared hosting. A dedicated server is more powerful than VPS, but getting a dedicated server is also more expensive.\n\nThink of it like this: VPS hosting is an apartment. Shared hosting is a single shared room and a dedicated server is a house. In the same way, buying your own house can be very expensive while you get almost no privacy with a shared room.\n\nVPS is less expensive than a dedicated hosting plan with a physical server and is more likely to fit the budget of a small to midsize business. The big kicker here is that VPS provides services that are almost like a dedicated host’s.\n\n## 2\\. You Gain Full Control of the Server\n\nDo you need specific software installed or port opened to operate your website? If you’ve been using shared servers, you might notice a waiting time before the provider supports the software.\n\nAs a VPS user, you have administrator-level access to the server’s operating system.\n\nThat means you can install any software, as long as it runs on the OS. If you need to install game management software, for example, you can do so without waiting for any hosting provider’s permission or support.\n\nWith VPS website hosting, you're the administrator of the server and IP. You can choose between fully-managed services and semi-managed hosting, where the web host handles some maintenance.\n\nFull control over your server also means you have root access and the ability to run scripts, some of which aren't allowed in a shared hosting environment.\n\n## 3\\. A VPS Plan Offers Data Backup \n\nAnything can happen when you’re on the internet. You could be unlucky enough to be the target of a data breach or a cyberattack. In case it might happen to you, you want to be ready.\n\nA big benefit of a VPS plan is data backup. Your data also gets stored on a virtual server, meaning you can access it with ease anywhere, anytime as long as you have an internet connection.\n\nTry to choose a service that allows manual data backup. This ensures you have restorable data and you know which data you have backed up.\n\n## 4\\. Get Reliable Web Security\n\nShared hosting has tons of risks, and one bad user can compromise the whole server. When one site on the server gets attacked, the attacker can target the other sites on the same server.\n\nIf you’ve had a security breach in the past, you know they're hard to clean up after. A data breach can make or break your website in a very short time.\n\nOne of the best benefits of VPS hosting is the security it offers your website.\n\nWe mentioned earlier that using a VPS is like sharing a dedicated server with other users. Even so, the virtual environment is still private, keeping your data separate and secure.\n\nIf you’re using a VPS for your gaming server, the same benefits will apply. High-level [security of a gaming server](https://aleforge.net/blog/play-safe-7-tips-to-help-you-boost-your-gaming-server-security) is something your users already expect. If your server gets attacked, it doesn’t only affect you but the other gamers on the server as well.\n\n## 5\\. VPS Resources Are Scalable and Customizable\n\nDo you plan to grow your website into something larger? If so, you'll want hosting resources that you can scale without much issue.\n\nWith VPS, you have an environment hosted within a “container”. Depending on the VPS hosting plan, this container has a certain amount of resources. As such, you can allocate more or fewer resources as you need them.\n\nFor example, if your business website is still quite small, you can scale your resources down to how much you need. You also pay only for the resources you use.\n\nAs a gaming website owner, you want to [enhance the gaming experience](https://aleforge.net/blog/how-using-a-server-will-enhance-your-gaming-experience) of the users of your game. You can tailor the server to meet the needs of the gaming website or mobile game app.\n\n## 6\\. Go Green on a Green Platform \n\nDid you know that [87% of consumers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesnycouncil/2018/11/21/do-customers-really-care-about-your-environmental-impact/#4648864a240d) will have a more positive image of a company that supports environmental issues? If you want to show your customers that you care about the environment, a VPS can help.\n\nDedicated servers only let one user profit from their power consumption. A VPS is a large dedicated server, but it’s divided into smaller parts. This allows multiple users to spread out their energy usage, decreasing the amount of power consumed per person and lowering your overall carbon footprint.\n\n## Make the Most of VPS Hosting \n\nThat’s it for our guide on the benefits of VPS hosting.
