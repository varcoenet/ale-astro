But have you ever considered hosting your own server?\n\nThis has a number of benefits, and though it can be done from home, it is not advised. Read on as we discuss why and how to find the best Minecraft server hosting.\n\n## Why Host Minecraft?\n\nMany people are looking for more out of the gaming experience. When it comes to world-building, it is not always enough to just rely on the game as it comes out of the box. Thus, there are several reasons you can benefit from having your own Minecraft server hosting.\n\n### Your Rules\n\nWhen you set up [Minecraft server hosting](https://aleforge.net/games/minecraftbedrock?_ga=2.67639059.325862406.1629879418-1790519649.1629879418), the whole world is in your hands. You are god, dictating how the world runs. You can decide upon spawn rates, landscapes, and anything else that takes your eye.\n\n### Low Cost\n\nIf you have set up a computer in the home to operate as a server, then you will realize that it does not come cheap. First, you have to power the computer seven days a week, all week. As well as the required energy, you will also have to pay costs for replacement parts and cooling.\n\nIn contrast, cheap Minecraft server hosting is available. Many companies, such as Aleforge, even offer free trials for a limited time.\n\n### Latency\n\nIf you have chosen to place your server on a home computer, several issues may spoil the enjoyment. Firstly, your internet connection will be a residential one. As it is not equipped for the speed required, you and other players may experience latency and drag.\n\nDedicated Minecraft server hosting will have speed as a priority. With the best equipment and connections, latency will be a thing of the past.\n\n### 24 Hour Access\n\nBy hosting Minecraft at home, you need your computer to be on 24 hours a day. If not, any active players elsewhere in the world would be thrown off when you shut down. Even if you need to update or upgrade, the network will still be offline for a while.\n\nEven cheap Minecraft server hosting will be online 24 hours a day. This means people on your server get access whenever they wish to play.\n\n### Professional Support\n\nUnless you are adept with technology, if your server goes offline or has performance issues, you may not know how to fix it. By getting a dedicated server, you have access to support. This can help work out the problems you may struggle to fix on your own.\n\n## What to Look For in a Minecraft Server\n\nTo get the best deal, there are a few considerations you need to take into account before signing up. When you find a server, then check they have the criteria from the list below.\n\n### Price\n\nEveryone will have a different budget when it comes to Minecraft. Some people may want to spend a little and play small games while others may want huge sprawling worlds. It is important that you can find a server to suit you and your prices.\n\nAleforge has a wide range of pricing options, going from a $4.50 monthly package all the way up to $72 a month. At checkout, these can even be customized giving you the perfect package for your money.\n\n### Range of Modpacks\n\nModpacks are a great way to customize your games. In fact, there are now over 15,000 [available for the game](https://ftb.fandom.com/wiki/Modpacks) itself. If you are not using them, then you severely limited your world-building ability.\n\nNo hosting services will be able to have all mod packs, as it becomes a security issue. However, you do want the ones with the most popular options such as Feed The Beast and Spigot.\n\n### Security\n\nOne thing that needs constant scrutiny is security. If your paid hosting is open to threats, then your server could go down and data could get stolen.\n\nMake sure the server has protection against DDoS attacks. In case accidents do occur, the hosting should provide regular backups so that the progression of your universe is saved automatically and never lost.\n\n### Locations\n\nMake sure you check out the location of the server, and that the company has a number of them. If not, you could have problems.\n\nImagine the server is located in Australia, but most of your players are in Europe. Information has to travel much further, reducing speed. Make sure the company has a choice of servers so your games are quick and easy.\n\n### Top Hardware\n\nThe technical aspects of good Minecraft server hosting are also vital. Without them, you may struggle to play larger games and add mod packs. You will find your games become extremely limited.\n\nAleforge has a minimum CPU speed of 3.8 GHz. The level of RAM is 32-64 GB DDR4 ECC, with NvME Samsung EVO Pro SSDs for storage.\n\n### Flexibility\n\nThings can change when you are gaming. You may have had a huge Minecraft world planned out, but realized you actually don't need it at all. Conversely, you may have a small package that is bursting at the seams as more players have joined you.\n\nIn these instances, you need flexibility. Make sure you are able to move the packages up and down as you wish, and as your gameplay dictates. In addition, you also want the flexibility to be able to import your own maps.\n\n## Finding the Best Minecraft Server Hosting\n\nIn summary, finding the best Minecraft server hosting is about getting what is right for you. Check it is secure, has the technology you need, and offers flexibility. Before long, you will have your own Minecraft world in the palm of your hand.\n\nYour first stop for game hosting should be Aleforge.
