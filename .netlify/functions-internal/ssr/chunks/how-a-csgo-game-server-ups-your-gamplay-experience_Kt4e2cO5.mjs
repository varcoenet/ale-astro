Its relative simplicity combined with high-speed gameplay makes it perfect for professional and casual gameplay. Very little is left up to chance, which makes it a great competitive game.\n\nBut are you having the greatest CS:GO experience possible?\n\nThe fact of the matter is, if you're not making use of dedicated game server hosting, you're not having the best gaming experience possible. This article will walk you through some of the greatest advantages of a CS:GO game server.\n\n## What Is a CSGO Game Server? \n\nA dedicated game server allows a client to play a game and run their own server without having to worry about all the technical baggage that normally comes with that.\n\nA dedicated game server will [host the server](https://aleforge.net/games/counter-strike-source) for you, but still allow you to be completely in control of your server. Think about it like getting catering for a party. You get to choose the food, and you choose when the food comes out, but you don't have to worry about making the food and serving it yourself.\n\n## Benefits of Dedicated Server Hosting\n\nIt's good to be king; running a dedicated server provides a plethora of advantages. Let's look at some of the reasons you should run your own server.\n\n### Better Performance\n\nYour computer might not just be able to handle what it takes to host a server. It's already hard to keep CS:GO up and running. You don't want your game to lag due to hosting a server — we all know the terrible consequences lagging can have in CS:GO.\n\nWhen you choose a company that dedicated its time to server hosting, you're putting yourself, your friends, and your entertainment, in the hands of pros. It's hard to think of a better way to improve a gaming experience.\n\n### Security\n\nThe last thing you want is for your server to get hacked. Whether someone is trying to steal your information, shut you down, or just troll you, hacking is sure to decrease your fun.\n\nWith all of the power, energy, and time it takes to play CS:GO well, it's going to be hard to make sure your server is secure. Putting it in the hands of professionals is a great way to make sure that your server stays secure.\n\n### Support\n\nIf you're running your own server all alone, you have nowhere to turn to when things go south. Videogames rely on technology after all; it doesn't take a hacker to bring a game grinding to a halt, sometimes it's just a bug.\n\nHaving an outside platform will help you keep your server up and running smoothly. It also helps assure the players on your server that they're in good hands.\n\nIf you run into an issue and say, \"don't worry, I'm contacting support\", they'll sit tight, and no you have it covered. If, on the other hand, all you can provide is \"uh, hold on\", they're more likely to look for other servers to play on.\n\n### All Day Play\n\nWith dedicated server hosting, your friends can hop onto your server and play even when you're not around. This will *vastly* improve their experience. Your server won't just become a place where people can congregate to play games, it'll become a cultural hub, an ever-running presence like Facebook or Discord.\n\nYour computer doesn't need to stay on in order to keep your server running, so you can give your computer a much-needed rest. A host server truly takes care of it all when it comes to your gameplay experience.\n\n### Control\n\nControl is not just great for megalomaniacs, it helps games run smoothly. There's a reason why most movies only have one director, and most books only have one author. As great as collaboration is, things get done when there's someone in charge.\n\nWhen you run your own server, you can play the game the way that you see fit. You can kick off people who are acting inappropriately, add more player slots because you're becoming more popular, and get your own values distributed throughout the CS:GO community. Who knows, you might even become a popular personality.\n\nControl also works in a practical capacity. As you most likely already know, players with [high ping](https://techterms.com/definition/ping) can decrease the quality of the game for all by adding a dreaded lag.\n\n### Fun Mods \n\nThis is less a benefit of hosting a dedicated server, and more a benefit of hosting a server in general. CS:GO is a highly creative and humorous community. If you have a taste for fun mods, but don't see them explored enough in the servers you play on, considering running your own server to play with the mods you most enjoy.\n\nHeck, you can set a schedule with your players where you play with certain mods at certain times during the week. You can have other days where straight-up competitive play is the law. This will turn your game server into something of a TV channel.\n\n## Run Your Own Server and Enjoy CS:GO \n\nCS:GO is one of the most popular games out there today, and there are many ways to play. However, if you're someone with a leader's spirit, it could be time to start running your own server.\n\nRunning a server by yourself isn't easy though. Consider teaming up with a great game server host, and enjoy your rule as the king of your own personal game network.\n\nFor more articles like this, check out our article on [starting and maintaining](https://aleforge.net/blog/3-tips-for-starting-and-maintaining-your-minecraft-server) a Minecraft server!\n";
