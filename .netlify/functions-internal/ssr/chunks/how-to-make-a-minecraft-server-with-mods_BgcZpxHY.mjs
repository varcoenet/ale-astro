With over [140 million active monthly players](https://www.searchlogistics.com/grow/statistics/minecraft-user-statistics/#Minecraft_Key_Statistics), it's still popular years after release.\n\nBut even a game as creative as Minecraft can get old. However, with some mods, you can change the game to your liking, and breathe new life into an old experience with new textures, creatures, and added functionality. Best of all, you can host a server and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nCurious about how to make a Minecraft server with mods? Whether you prefer the Bedrock or Java Edition, this guide will get you started.\n\n## How to Make a Minecraft Server With Mods\n\nCreating a Minecraft server isn't necessarily difficult, but it does require some technical know-how. It always requires some knowledge of the game and what you want to get out of your gaming experience.\n\n### Technical Requirements\n\nLet's start by talking about the technical requirements. At the very minimum, you will need the following:\n\n- Copy of Minecraft\n- Internet connection\n- Login information for your router\n- Computer with at least 4 GB of RAM\n\nDepending on what mods you intend on installing, you may have greater technical requirements. This is especially true of RAM requirements.\n\n### Choose Your Version of Minecraft\n\nThere are two different versions of Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition.\n\nThe Java Editon was programmed in Java. It was originally released in 2009 by Mojang when it was just called Minecraft. It's exclusive to PC, MAC, and Linux.\n\nMinecraft Bedrock is the newest version, released in 2017. It's built on the Bedrock Engine.\n\nThe Bedrock Edition is a complete remake of the game. It's written in C++. Bedrock's greatest feature is that it allows for cross-platform play, meaning that you and your friends can play together across PC and consoles.\n\nThe technical differences mean that many third-party tools that were designed for the Java Edition will not work with the Bedrock Edition. This is because the Java Edition uses the Anvil format for world storage, while the Bedrock Editon uses the LevelDB format.\n\nBasically, the different versions of the game generate worlds differently. This means the two editions are not cross-compatible.\n\nThere are a few other technical differences as well. For most people, those technical differences are minor and won't matter. However, it's important to note that Bedrock Edition tends to run better on lower-end devices, due to it being designed to function cross-platform (including on mobile devices).\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Bedrock Edition offers achievements and extra in-game items. However, Java offers a lot more mods. Bedrock does have add-ons, but Java Edition has tons of mods than enable you to completely change the game.\n\nIf you want to play with others (especially on a console) and want better performance, choose Bedrock. If you want access to the greatest number of server mods, go with Java. Ultimately [choosing a version of Minecraft](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-which-version-is-best-for-playing-mojangs-game/1100-6502838/) depends on your preferences.\n\nThe good news is that if you purchase the Java Edition of Minecraft, you get the Bedrock Edition for free.\n\n### Install Minecraft\n\nObviously, if you don't have Minecraft installed, you need to install it. It's a fairly straightforward process. Head over to the [official Minecraft download page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft) and follow the on-screen prompts to download and install it, as well as the server software (if you plan on hosting a server of your own).\n\n### Choose and Install Your Mod Manager\n\nTo handle all of your Minecraft mods, it's best to install a mod manager. A mod manager simply acts as an easy all-in-one interface to manage your library of mods. They make installing and managing multiple mods easy.\n\nThere are a few different mod managers available. [Minecraft Forge](https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/how-to-install-minecraft-forge) is one of the more popular ones.\n\nNot every mod will be compatible with every launcher. Take a look at some of the Minecraft mods available and find out which launchers they are compatible with.\n\nThe directions for installing and setting up a mod manager vary depending on the mod manager you choose, so consult the specific launcher's guide for help with this.\n\nIf you're not sure which mod manager to use, you can always stick to the [official Minecraft Launcher](https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/Minecraft-Launcher/9PGW18NPBZV5) for Windows 10 and 11. It allows you to launch Minecraft Bedrock, Java, and Minecraft Dungeons all from the same launcher.\n\n### Choose Your Mods\n\nMinecraft has been popular in the modding community for a long time. There are loads of [Minecraft mods](https://aleforge.net/blog/everything-to-know-about-modded-minecraft) available.\n\nSome add in new textures or materials, altering the look of the game. Some add new enemy types. Other mods are more utilitarian in nature, adding functionality to the game.\n\nWhen choosing mods, take note of which versions of Minecraft they are compatible with. Some mods may not be compatible with the latest updates of the game.\n\nSome popular sites to find Minecraft mods are CurseForge, MinecraftMods, and Planet Minecraft.\n\n### Install Your Mods\n\nNow that you have your mods ready, it's time to install them. The specific instructions will vary from one launcher to another.\n\nHowever, if you're using the popular launcher Forge, it's easy to get started. Once you have your game and launcher installed, open the Minecraft launcher.\n\nFrom the bottom left of the launcher, change the profile to \"forge.\" When the game starts, you should see a \"Mods\" menu at the start screen.\n\nNow you need to move your mod files into the newly created Forge mods folder.\n\nBy default, on PC that folder's address is: C:\\\\Users\\\\\\[your username\\]\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\.minecraft\\\\mods\n\nOn Mac, the folder address is: \\[your computer's name\\] > Macintosh HD > Users > \\[your username\\] > Library > Application Support > minecraft > mods\n\nIf installed correctly, you should be able to see your available mods after selecting the \"Mods\" button from the game's main menu.\n\nNow you're set up and ready to play modded Minecraft. Now you're ready to set up and connect to your server.\n\n## Configuring Your Bedrock Server\n\nStart by extracting your downloaded server files. Now open the \"server.properties\" file and edit it. This file contains your basic server properties.\n\nNow you need to exempt Minecraft from UWP loopback restrictions. Doing this allows you to both host and connect to a server on the same computer.\n\nOpen your command prompt and paste the following command into it:  \nCheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt –a –p=S-1-15-2-1958404141-86561845-1752920682-3514627264-368642714-62675701-733520436\n\nHit enter and execute the command.\n\n### Enable Port Forwarding\n\nNow you need to find your IP address via the command prompt. Type ipconfig /all into the prompt and hit enter. It should show an IP4, IP6, and Default Gateway address.\n\nNow you have to open your router and change your system port settings. Unfortunately, every router is different, so you will need to consult your router manufacturer's directions.\n\n### Connecting to Your Server\n\nStart by opening Minecraft. From the main menu hit play, and select the servers tab. Select the \"Add Server\" option.\n\nEnter your server details. This includes the public IP address, port ID (by default it's 19132), and your server's name.\n\nHit play and a new world should be generated for you and your friends to play in.\n\n## Configuring Your Java Server\n\nConfiguring a Minecraft Java server is different. Make sure you have Java installed and up to date on your PC, so it can run .jar files. Then [download the Java Edition server](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server).\n\nNow you need to create a desktop folder for your server files. Copy and paste the .jar file you downloaded into this folder.\n\nNow open the command prompt and paste the address of your server directory. Hit enter. Then type the following command and hit enter:  \nJava -jar “name of your jar”.jar\n\nBack in the server folder open the eula.txt file. Change eula=false to eula=true. Save and exit.\n\nFrom there, you have some additional work to do, such as editing the server.properties file - just like you would do with the Bedrock Edition.\n\nLike with Bedrock, you need to enable port forwarding. However, for the Java Edition, the default port is 25565.\n\nOverall, installing, configuring, and connecting to the Java Edition server isn't as friendly as it is for the Bedrock Edition. Consult the official [Java Edition server setup guide](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360058525452-How-to-Setup-a-Minecraft-Java-Edition-Server) if you need to.\n\n## The Easiest Way to Host a Server\n\nIf setting up a modded Minecraft server sounds complicated, it definitely can be.\n\nBy far the best and easiest way to make a Minecraft server with mods is to use AleForge's Minecraft server hosting. We offer server mods for both Java and Bedrock Editions.\n\nAlong with modpack installation, we offer scheduled backups, fast SSD storage, DDos protection, and 24/7 support.\n\nIf you're wondering how to make a Minecraft server with mods, and want something that's easy to set up and affordable to use, we can help.\n\nCheck out our [Minecraft server hosting options here](https://aleforge.net/games/minecraft).\n";
