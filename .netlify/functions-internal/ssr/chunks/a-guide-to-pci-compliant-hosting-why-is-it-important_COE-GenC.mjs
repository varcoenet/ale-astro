The first source says that over 70% of gamers get mental stimulation, relaxation, and stress relief, all from playing video games.\n\nThe male to female ratio is almost equal, and people from all different backgrounds and ages play video games.\n\nThe best way to ensure that you don't ruin the gaming experience for yourself or others is to make sure that your website or server is PCI compliant. Nothing is worse than being at fault for a security breach that affects your customers or your friends.\n\nExplore this guide to find out why PCI compliant hosting is necessary for website owners.\n\n## What Does PCI Compliant Mean?\n\nPCI stands for Payment Card Industry. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the payment process industry that has set the standards for data security when it comes to making payments.\n\nIf you have a business that accepts credit card payments offline or online, you or your business must comply with network rules and credit card associations concerning data security.\n\nIf you accept any form of payment by card, whether it's a debit card or a gift card, you must comply with these rules and regulations.\n\nNot all of the details of PCI Compliance are left up to you. Some are taken care of by your web host. Some are taken care of by your payment processor, and some are your responsibility.\n\nIf you run a website or business, it's all up to you. And if you're looking for the right game server for [you and your friends](https://aleforge.net/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-game-server-hosting), make sure it has the right credentials.\n\n## What Are the PCI Compliant Hosting Requirements?\n\nBecause PCI Compliance is so critical, there are strict requirements surrounding it. Here are PCI council's recommendations for compliant server requirements.\n\n- Properly configured and installed firewalls and routers\n- Defenses on PCI info in storage\n- Encryption of any data transmission on public networks\n- Replacement of all default passwords\n- Regularly updated and used antivirus software\n- Maintenance of secure systems and software\n- Business need-to-know access control\n- Strict physical access controls\n- Unique IDs for every individual with access\n- Data and network access tracking and monitoring\n- Regular testing of all security measures and mechanisms\n- Information security policy\n\n## What Do the Requirements Mean?\n\nOne of the most fundamental requirements of PCI hosting is **the firewall**. If you want to be able to control the traffic that enters and exits a network, you'll have to incorporate at least one firewall.\n\nPCI standards recommend that information stored on a card chip or a strip is NEVER stored.

For any outsider that enters the facility, business owners should make sure there is no chance for those outsiders to physically access ANY components of the data center.\n\n## Monitoring and Testing Is Important Too\n\nDid you know that [EVERY 39 seconds](https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/hacking-statistics), there is a hacker attack? The United States cybersecurity budget is almost 15 billion dollars.\n\nThose who provide PCI compliant shared hosting use monitoring to make sure breaches don't happen.\n\nBeing able to track your users allows for analytics that help determine how improper use or hacking occurs.
