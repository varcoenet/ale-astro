Whether you prefer the Bedrock or Java Edition, this guide will get you started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-a-minecraft-server-with-mods\">How to Make a Minecraft Server With Mods</h2>\n<p>Creating a Minecraft server isn’t necessarily difficult, but it does require some technical know-how. It always requires some knowledge of the game and what you want to get out of your gaming experience.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technical-requirements\">Technical Requirements</h3>\n<p>Let’s start by talking about the technical requirements. At the very minimum, you will need the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Copy of Minecraft</li>\n<li>Internet connection</li>\n<li>Login information for your router</li>\n<li>Computer with at least 4 GB of RAM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on what mods you intend on installing, you may have greater technical requirements. This is especially true of RAM requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"choose-your-version-of-minecraft\">Choose Your Version of Minecraft</h3>\n<p>There are two different versions of Minecraft: Java and Bedrock Edition.</p>\n<p>The Java Editon was programmed in Java. It was originally released in 2009 by Mojang when it was just called Minecraft. It’s exclusive to PC, MAC, and Linux.</p>\n<p>Minecraft Bedrock is the newest version, released in 2017. It’s built on the Bedrock Engine.</p>\n<p>The Bedrock Edition is a complete remake of the game. It’s written in C++. Bedrock’s greatest feature is that it allows for cross-platform play, meaning that you and your friends can play together across PC and consoles.</p>\n<p>The technical differences mean that many third-party tools that were designed for the Java Edition will not work with the Bedrock Edition. This is because the Java Edition uses the Anvil format for world storage, while the Bedrock Editon uses the LevelDB format.</p>\n<p>Basically, the different versions of the game generate worlds differently. This means the two editions are not cross-compatible.</p>\n<p>There are a few other technical differences as well. For most people, those technical differences are minor and won’t matter. However, it’s important to note that Bedrock Edition tends to run better on lower-end devices, due to it being designed to function cross-platform (including on mobile devices).</p>\n<p>From a gameplay perspective, Bedrock Edition offers achievements and extra in-game items. However, Java offers a lot more mods. Bedrock does have add-ons, but Java Edition has tons of mods than enable you to completely change the game.</p>\n<p>If you want to play with others (especially on a console) and want better performance, choose Bedrock.

It’s a fairly straightforward process.

A mod manager simply acts as an easy all-in-one interface to manage your library of mods. They make installing and managing multiple mods easy.</p>\n<p>There are a few different mod managers available. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/minecraft/how-to-install-minecraft-forge\">Minecraft Forge</a> is one of the more popular ones.</p>\n<p>Not every mod will be compatible with every launcher.

Once you have your game and launcher installed, open the Minecraft launcher.</p>\n<p>From the bottom left of the launcher, change the profile to “forge.” When the game starts, you should see a “Mods” menu at the start screen.</p>\n<p>Now you need to move your mod files into the newly created Forge mods folder.</p>\n<p>By default, on PC that folder’s address is: C:\\Users\\[your username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\.minecraft\\mods</p>\n<p>On Mac, the folder address is: [your computer’s name] > Macintosh HD > Users > [your username] > Library > Application Support > minecraft > mods</p>\n<p>If installed correctly, you should be able to see your available mods after selecting the “Mods” button from the game’s main menu.</p>\n<p>Now you’re set up and ready to play modded Minecraft.
