Combining this with other methods, such as switching to a dual-band router, reducing interference from electronics and appliances, or updating firmware, can help ensure you get the best internet speeds possible. Home Wi-Fi routers perform best when set up centrally with few walls or obstructions blocking their signal. Make sure that your router is in an open and elevated area. If placed too close to floor level, this can cause furniture and other objects to block the signal. Setting up antennas at a 45-degree angle along the wall furthest from your router also helps to increase performance.
