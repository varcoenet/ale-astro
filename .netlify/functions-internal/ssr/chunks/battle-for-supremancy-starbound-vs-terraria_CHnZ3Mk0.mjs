Starbound and Terraria are sandbox adventure games, allowing players to get creative in how they play the game.</p>\n<p>Both games feature similar character development systems. You can level up your skills, collect resources, and create a base of operations. You also need to craft various pieces of equipment and can go on in-game quests.</p>\n<p>Before deciding which game is suitable for you, it’s best to look at each game individually. Think about what you and your friends enjoy in a game and which one might be best for you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"starbound\">Starbound</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://aleforge.net/games/starbound\">Starbound</a>, as the name suggests, is a space-themed game. Players customize a spaceship and voyage to new planets, discovering new items, ship parts, friends, and enemies.</p>\n<p>The game takes place in a richly developed sci-fi world. There are lots of aliens and characters to meet as well as a storyline you can follow if you wish.</p>\n<h3 id=\"gameplay\">Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As a sandbox game, Starbound allows players to choose their own adventure. At the start of the game, you’ll create your character and ship, then set out on a journey.</p>\n<p>What you do is up to you, but plenty of options are available. You can enjoy quests if you want to enjoy the game’s narrative, or you can focus on building a base or customizing your ship.</p>\n<p>Quests are pretty diverse too. You might be tasked with finding a lost relic on a mysterious planet. Or you could turn <a href=\"https://playstarbound.com/starbound-1-4-bounty-hunter-update/\">bounty hunter</a> and track down an intergalactic bandit.</p>\n<p>There are lots of collectibles to hunt down too. You can even find musical instruments to use on your ship or in your base! Everywhere you turn in the game, you’ll find something new or exciting. The universe is full of surprises!</p>\n<h3 id=\"graphics\">Graphics</h3>\n<p>The 2D graphics are pretty basic. But the subdued color palette is easy on the eyes. There are also lots of menus for characters and crafting options, allowing you to get a slightly more detailed look at the game.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creative-features\">Creative Features</h3>\n<p>For creative types, Starbound may be the better choice. Its procedurally generated features and options for terraforming new worlds make it the perfect option for those with big imaginations.</p>\n<p>When you touch down on a new planet, you can set up a base on the new world. To do this, you’ll need to gather resources by mining and exploring. Over time, you’ll turn the planet into the world of your dreams.</p>\n<p>The almost infinite nature of Starbound’s world works well for those who love to work on lots of different projects at once. If you run out of space with one of your bases or something goes wrong, there’s no need to despair!</p>\n<p>And the creativity doesn’t stop when you’re whizzing through space. Ships have a range of features for customization, allowing you to change the look and performance of the ship according to your desire.</p>\n<p>You can also hire a crew for your ship! You can hire characters from all races to work as engineers, tailors, and security officers. Some crew members can be recruited through quests and will wander around your ship as you travel.</p>\n<h3 id=\"character-customization\">Character Customization</h3>\n<p>Characters can be customized heavily in Starbound. From aesthetics to game stats, there are many different reasons to change your character. This broad choice also adds replayability value to the game since you can enjoy adventures under several different personas.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://playstarbound.com/starbound-races/\">seven races</a> to choose from in the game. Players can choose their character to be a human, a glitch (a kind of medieval robot), or a gassy Novakid! You can also select the gender of your character along with their skin or fur color.</p>\n<p>Each race benefits from unique types of armor and ship parts. There are also different skills available. With hundreds of thousands of character combinations available, there’s no end to how you can play the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"terraria\">Terraria</h2>\n<p>While Starbound is set in a futuristic world of advanced technology and space travel, Terraria takes place in a medieval fantasy world.

Players begin with essential tools and must build up their equipment and skills as they journey through the world. There are several choices of core game modes that alter the game’s difficulty level and impact some other conditions.</p>\n<p>Players progress in the game by fighting against bosses. Many of these bosses are extremely tough, requiring a lot of grinding and skill to beat. The game gets more challenging for all players after certain bosses are defeated, so things can be a little tough for less capable members of a group.</p>\n<p>That makes Terraria the ideal game for those who love a challenge. Bosses use various combat mechanics, so you’ll need to be on your toes to beat them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"graphics-1\">Graphics</h3>\n<p>This pixelated game has a simple graphical style that’s appealing to many.
