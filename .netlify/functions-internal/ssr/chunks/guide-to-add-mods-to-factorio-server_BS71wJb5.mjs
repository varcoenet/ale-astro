Although this game is known for its elements that require resource management and critical thinking, it can become a bit stale over time if you only play the vanilla version. The good news is that it's possible to use Factorio mods to help enhance your experience.\n\nHowever, not everybody understands how to add them to a Factorio server. Let's take a look at everything you need to know so that you can take your gaming sessions to the next level.\n\n## What Are the Benefits of Using Mods?\n\nThere are quite a few benefits that come with using mods in Factorio. For one, they can help to improve the overall gameplay experience.\n\nThis is because mods can add new features and content to the game. Additionally, they can also help to make the game more challenging, which can be great for those who are looking for something more difficult than vanilla content.\n\nMods can also help to improve the visuals of the game. This is especially true for those who are looking for a more immersive experience.\n\nSome mods provide such a difficulty spike that even seasoned players find the challenge overwhelming at first. It's worth noting that you can use mods to help create a personalized experience when playing the game.\n\nFor example, many different texture packs can reskin certain elements of the game to look like something else. A common resource that texture packs draw from includes movies, other video games, etc.\n\nKeep this in mind when searching for mods to add to your server. Even a simple change in appearance could make the game feel much fresher.\n\n## How Do You Install Mods?\n\nInstalling mods in Factorio is a pretty simple process. The first thing that you need to do is find the mod that you want to use.\n\nOnce you've done that, you'll need to download the files for the mod.

One of the most prominent is extracting the mods to the wrong folder. Not only will this prevent you from using the mods correctly, but it can also interfere with other game files.\n\nIn some cases, doing so could cause a game to crash upon start-up. In a situation like this, you may be forced to uninstall and then reinstall the game. Another mistake that people make is not checking the compatibility notes of the mod they download.\n\nSome mods do not work with certain versions of Factorio. Running the wrong mods could impact the integrity of your saved data, so use caution. You should also keep in mind that the installation instructions are often different depending on what operating system you use for your device.\n\nTo clarify, Windows and Mac users will need to follow different steps to ensure they install the mods correctly. Be sure that you read the insulation instructions carefully so you avoid potential issues with your game.\n\n## What Are the Best Mods?\n\nThere are a ton of great mods out there for Factorio.

This is mostly a quality-of-life update. It aims to make the game more pleasant to play overall.\n\n### Air Transport\n\nThis mod adds a new way to transport resources via aircraft.\n\nSimilar to the Logistics Train Network mod, Air Transport establishes an additional method for resource transportation.

It's no secret that using weapons with low accuracy can easily become frustrating.

As you might guess, this is one of the most entertaining on this list.\n\nNuclear energy comes with a wide range of mechanics, and it can be used as a powerful resource for your factories.\n\n## Where Should I Look For Mods?\n\nThere are many different online resources you can tap into. However, you need to avoid shady websites at all costs. If something about the site seems off or if there isn't any community engagement that you can reference, you should leave the site immediately.\n\nMore often than not, suspicious websites aim to install malware on your computer once you click the download link. In many cases, this could be a situation that is difficult or even impossible to recover from without the help professional.\n\n## How Do I Host My Own Server?\n\nIf you're looking to add mods to your [Factorio server](https://aleforge.net/blog/5-things-to-look-for-a-factorio-server), you'll need to host it yourself. The good news is that this is actually a pretty easy process.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that you'll need to do in order to get started.

You'll want to look into what past customers have had to say in order to gain insight into the experience you can anticipate from working with them.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that not all feedback you encounter online is always genuine.

Or, they may charge you for a final month even if you wish to cancel your subscription at that moment.\n\nThe good news is that a bit of research can help prevent working with lackluster hosting providers like these.\n\nAnother key question to ask your potential provider is how they handle security.\n\nUnfortunately, the cybercrime industry is projected to be worth [over $10 trillion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cybercrime-cost-world-10-5-160300027.html) by 2025.
